# Polyfill Example of Promises in React

Let's say you have a React project that you want to run in Internet Explorer 11, which doesn't support the `Promise` object. To make your code compatible with this browser, you can use a polyfill.

1. First, install the `es6-promise` package using npm:
```
npm install es6-promise
```
2. Next, import the polyfill at the top of your `index.js` file:
```
// index.js

import 'es6-promise/auto';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

```

Now you can use `Promise` objects in your React code without worrying about browser compatibility:
```
// App.js

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Create a new promise
    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve('Data loaded successfully!');
      }, 2000);
    });

    // Use the promise
    promise.then((data) => {
      console.log(data);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
In this example, we're using the `es6-promise` polyfill to support the use of `Promise` objects in our React code. We create a new `Promise` object that resolves after two seconds, and use the `then()` method to log the resolved value to the console.
